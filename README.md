# match_n_match
The purpose of this function is to find out whether two strings match.

• s1 and s2 are considered to match when s1 and s2 are identical.

• If s2 contains a star (’*’), we can replace this star by any characters string (even
empty) to make s1 and s2 identical.

• s2 may hold as many stars as you’d like.

• For example, "main.c" and "*.c" match because it is possible to replace ’*’ by
the string "main" to render those two strings identical.

• It must return 1 if s1 and s2 match, or 0 if they don’t.
